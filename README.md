# HERO-CUBE

### Description
HERO CUBE is considered an old-school game. The player must progress by multiplying the trials, and must often avoid particularly well hidden traps. These traps require a lot of reflexes. In some levels, the player has to make their character jump, which barely manages to not fall. Some levels are timed, which increases the difficulty of the game. Sometimes the player will have to solve puzzles, often based on physics, which can sometimes be very difficult.
